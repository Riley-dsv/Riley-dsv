# Hi, I'm Riley

## About

I'm a student in **BUT Informatique**, I am fond of programming, optimisation and functionnal paradigm.

I mostly work with :
- **C**
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **COBOL**
- **Pascal**

Yes, I like **legacy code**. ( Someone must maintain it, right ? )

## At the moment

- I learn **PHP**
- I discover **Ada**
- I practice **Clean Code** principles and **SOLID** design

## I like...

- Tinker old system to understand how it used to work and the intents of the previous devs
- Write clean and durable code. And read code that is not.
- Spend 4 days automating a 1 minute task.

## Fun fact
